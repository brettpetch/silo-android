# Four-client feature comparison — iOS / tvOS / Android mobile / Android TV (2026-06-17)

Feature parity across all four Silo clients. Inventories: Apple (iOS + tvOS) via Codex reads of `silo-apple`; Android (mobile + TV) from the TV parity review + screen maps. UI/visual styling is a *separate* axis (see the tvOS-UI-match sizing work) — this doc is **features only**.

## Strategic read
- **Android mobile is the feature leader** — the only client with the full set.
- **Apple (iOS + tvOS) is feature-light:** both lack Requests, Notifications, Watch Together, Ebook reading, Downloads, Subtitle search, and AI subtitle translation. Polished, but narrower.
- **Copying the tvOS *UI* ≠ copying tvOS *features*.** The visual-match project must **not** shrink Android's richer feature set to match Apple. Several Android features (Requests, Notifications, Watch Together, Ebook, Downloads, Subtitle-AI) have **no Aurora design** — restyling them means *designing new Aurora-style screens*, which the pure-reskin estimate didn't include.
- **Android TV is the weakest of the four on features it *should* have:** no full Calendar, no person-detail nav, profiles select-only, collections read-only, no forced-subtitle setting, plus the player correctness regressions in `2026-06-17-tv-client-parity-review.md`. This is the "get it up to snuff" backlog (functional first; visuals later).

## Caveats
Static + targeted-read inventories; Apple cells not device-verified. Android mobile cells from prior review + screen maps. "—" = not applicable to that form factor.
