/**
 * Merges server-stored downloaded subtitles into a playback session's track
 * list without restarting the session. Pure; shared by the mobile and TV
 * players' `refreshSubtitles(autoSelectSubtitleId)`.
 *
 * Mirrors the web reference exactly (web/src/player/hooks/usePlaybackSession.ts
 * `refreshSubtitles`, lines ~473-514):
 *  - strips every previously merged `source == "downloaded"` track and
 *    rebuilds them all from the fresh GET /subtitles/{media_file_id} list
 *    (PlayerSubtitleInfo carries no downloaded-subtitle id, and the web
 *    dedupes by source replacement, not identity)
 *  - new indices continue from `max(existing.index) + 1` — not the list size,
 *    since server-side burn-in skipping can leave index gaps — starting at 0
 *    when there are no remaining tracks
 *  - label is `"${release_name} (${provider})"`, codec is the stored format
 *  - the track URL mirrors the playback API's own delivery-format extension:
 *    ASS/SSA stays raw, PGS stays `.sup`, and other text subtitles are served
 *    as WebVTT. Android resolves it through the same `/api/v1` stream mount as
 *    server-provided subtitle URLs and injects Authorization headers through
 *    MediaAuthInterceptor.
 *
 * Existing tracks keep their list positions, so the players' position-based
 * text-track selection (SubtitleManager.selectSubtitle) survives the merge.
 * The track for a given [DownloadedSubtitle.id] ends up at merged position
 * `mergedSize - downloaded.size + downloaded.indexOfFirst { it.id == id }`,
 * which is what auto-select-after-download callers rely on.
