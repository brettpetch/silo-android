/**
 * Local-only on-disk record stored next to a downloaded media file at
 * `<filesDir>/downloads/<serverId>/<profileId>/<fileId>.record.json`.
 *
 * Unlike [DownloadRecord] (which is the wire shape — strictly mirrors the
 * server's `downloadResponse` struct and cannot grow new fields without
 * breaking the API contract), the sidecar is the client's full picture of
 * what's on disk: server state + the catalog metadata we need to render
 * the row offline. The whole reason it exists: without the catalog fields
 * stashed locally, an offline Downloads tab can show neither title nor
 * poster even when the bytes are sitting right there on disk.
 *
 * Written by [com.continuum.app.common.downloads.DownloadEnqueuer] at
 * download start and rewritten by [com.continuum.app.common.downloads.DownloadWorker]
 * on every status transition (downloading → completed / failed). Read by
 * [com.continuum.app.repository.DownloadsRepository] on init to seed the
 * in-memory cache before any server refresh, and by the player's offline
 * path to find the local file's contentId without a network round-trip.
