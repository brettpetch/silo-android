/**
 * Media-type classification stamped onto each [DownloadSidecar] at queue
 * time. Determines which section of the Downloads tab a record renders
 * under and which renderer the UI uses.
 *
 * Adding a new type (e.g. comic, podcast) is a single enum entry + a
 * dedicated section renderer; nothing else in the storage / repository
 * layer needs to change.
 *
 * Wire strings are stable — they're persisted in JSON sidecars on disk
 * and must keep their existing spelling across app versions. [Unknown]
 * is the safe fallback for sidecars written before this enum existed.
