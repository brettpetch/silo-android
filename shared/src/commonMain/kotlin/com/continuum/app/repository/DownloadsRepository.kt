/**

 * screen, item-detail download button, and the WorkManager-driven download
 * worker can all observe the same state without polling the API
 * independently.
 *
 * **Disk-as-truth (v1.1).** The Android side seeds this cache from the
 * on-disk sidecar files at startup via [seedFromSidecars]. [refresh] then
 * *merges* the server view into that cache instead of overwriting it —
 * server-known records win on conflict (fresher status), but records that
 * only exist on disk (server cleaned them up while we were offline, or we
 * marked them [pendingDelete] but haven't synced yet) stay visible.
 *
 * **Two-phase delete.** The server has a quirky DELETE: for active records
 * (queued / downloading) it only flips status to cancelled rather than
 * removing the row; you have to DELETE again once it's cancelled to
 * actually remove it. Until then [refresh] would faithfully re-add the
 * ghost. We track [pendingDelete] ids and filter them out of [refresh]'s
 * merge so a deleted-by-the-user record stays gone even if it bounces
 * back from the server.
