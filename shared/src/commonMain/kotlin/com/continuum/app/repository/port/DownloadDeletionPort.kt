/**
 * Durable record of a download the user deleted but whose **server** download
 * record may not yet be gone (Track B, offline-first delete). A download delete
 * removes the on-device bytes + Room metadata immediately and enqueues a tombstone
 * here; the server `DELETE /downloads/{id}` is replayed on the next online refresh
 * and the tombstone is cleared only once the server's list confirms the record is
 * gone. Until then [DownloadsRepository][com.continuum.app.repository.DownloadsRepository]
 * filters the recordId out of every refresh so a still-present server record can't
 * resurrect as a "ghost" pointing at deleted files.
 *
 * commonMain port (so the shared repository can depend on it) with a Room-backed
 * Android impl bound in the platform module; default no-op keeps non-Android /
 * tests network-only (delete stays server-first there).
 *
 * Keyed by `(serverId, profileId, recordId)` — not recordId alone — so clearing a
 * tombstone after one scope's list confirms absence can never drop another scope's
 * pending delete (recordIds are server-unique, but the *clear* decision is
 * scope-local). [mediaFileId] is carried so a crash between enqueue and on-device
 * byte deletion can be finished idempotently on the next launch.
