/**
 * Local-first side-channel for **content-level** user-state mutations
 * (watched / favorite / rating). The strangler entry point for Track B:
 * [com.continuum.app.repository.PersonalDataRepository] records each mutation
 * through this port (optimistic local projection + a durable outbox op) before
 * calling the server, then [resolve]s the op with the network outcome.
 *
 * The port lives in `commonMain` so the shared repository can depend on it; the
 * real Room-backed implementation is Android-only and bound in the platform DI
 * module. On any target without that binding (commonMain tests), the
 * [NoOpUserItemStatePort] default keeps behaviour exactly network-only.
 *
 * Contract: `record*` persists the projection + a pending outbox op atomically
 * and returns a [OutboxHandle]; the caller then calls [resolve] with the
 * server result so the op can be acked, kept for retry, or dropped.
