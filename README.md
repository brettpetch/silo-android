# Silo Android

Android **phone** and **Android TV** clients for the [Silo](https://github.com/Silo-Server/silo-server) self-hosted media server — stream and download your movies, shows, music, audiobooks, and ebooks, with quality-aware playback and multi-server/multi-profile support.

Built as a Kotlin Multiplatform project: one shared business-logic core, two Jetpack Compose apps (touch + 10-foot TV). The repo preserves the existing application IDs and Kotlin package namespaces (`com.continuum.app`) for install continuity, but all user-facing names and server references use Silo.

> **Status:** Early WIP (`v0.1.0`). The architecture is solid and the feature surface is broad; some areas are intentionally "bones-level" and under active redesign (see [Roadmap](#roadmap)).
>
> **Current exposure note:** Requests, Admin, and Watch Together are not currently accessible in the Android phone or Android TV apps. Some shared repositories, routes, or older screen code may still exist, but there is no production user entry point for those surfaces on this branch.

## What's inside

| | |
|---|---|
| **Apps** | Phone (`com.continuum.app`) · Android TV (`com.continuum.app.tv`) |
| **Language / UI** | Kotlin 2.1.20 · Jetpack Compose (Material 3) · Compose for TV (`androidx.tv`) |
| **Playback** | AndroidX **Media3 / ExoPlayer** 1.10.0 (+ optional FFmpeg audio extension, optional MPV backend path) |
| **Networking** | **Ktor** 3.1.2 client · kotlinx.serialization · WebSockets for realtime |
| **DI** | **Koin** 4.1.0 |
| **Persistence** | AndroidX DataStore · EncryptedSharedPreferences (tokens) · WorkManager (downloads) |
| **Images** | Coil 3 (Ktor-backed) |
| **SDK** | minSdk 24 · targetSdk 35 · compileSdk 36 · JDK 21 |

The clients talk to a Silo server over its `/api/v1/*` REST + WebSocket API. The server owns the library, scanning, metadata, transcoding decisions, and auth; the clients render it and drive playback.

## Feature overview

A condensed tour. For the exhaustive, per-feature checklist (with phone/TV coverage and file pointers) see **[FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md)**.

### 📺 Playback (phone + TV)
- **Adaptive delivery** — the server picks **Direct Play**, **Remux**, or **Transcode** from the device's real capabilities; the client can also fall back to transcode at runtime if a track turns out to be undecodable (e.g. an AV receiver is unplugged mid-stream).
- **Deep capability detection** — enumerates hardware decoders (H.264, HEVC, AV1, VP9, **Dolby Vision** profiles 5/7/8), panel HDR (HDR10, HDR10+, HLG, DV), and audio-sink passthrough (**E-AC3 JOC/Atmos, TrueHD, DTS-HD**); an optional bundled **FFmpeg** audio decoder fills gaps for lossless codecs.
- **Quality-of-life** — staged playback buffering, per-content **refresh-rate matching** (phone), HDR toggle, intro auto-skip, chapters, sleep timer, playback speed, configurable video gravity (fit/fill/stretch).
- **Tracks & subtitles** — audio-track switching (incl. mid-stream), subtitle selection with **styling, position, and sync offset**, plus a subtitle suite: provider **search & download** and **AI transcription/translation** with quota tracking.
- **System integration** — single Media3 `MediaSession` powers lock-screen / notification / headset / Assistant controls; TV adds D-pad transport, an info HUD, a chapter scrubber, and HDMI EDID-driven display-mode selection.

### Watch Together
Not currently exposed on Android phone or Android TV. Shared sync infrastructure and design notes may exist in the repository, but users cannot create or join Watch Together sessions from the apps on this branch.

### ⬇️ Offline & Downloads (phone)
WorkManager-backed downloads of video, audiobooks, and books to public device storage (scoped `MediaStore` on API 30+), preserving original filenames/formats so other apps can discover and open them. Metadata lives in Room, local playback/read paths work without a server session, and the app can boot straight to Downloads when launched offline.

### 📚 Library, browse & discovery (phone + TV)
- **Phone navigation** — Home, Libraries, For You, Calendar, and Downloads when the active profile has downloads. Video / Audio / Reading are library modes, not bottom-nav tabs.
- **TV navigation** — Home, visible media-type tabs derived from server libraries (Movies/TV/Music/Audiobooks), and Calendar. Reading/ebooks are intentionally excluded from TV.
- **Home** with Continue Watching, Recently Added/Released, and server-curated recommendation rows.
- **Browse** with genre/rating filters, sorting, and infinite-scroll grids; **collections**; rich **item detail** (movies, series → seasons → episodes, multi-version files, cast/crew).
- **Search** scoped by media type, debounced and paginated.
- **Not exposed** — Requests, Admin, and Watch Together are not reachable app surfaces today.

### 📖 Reading & 🎧 Audio
- **Ebook reader (phone only)** — EPUB, PDF, CBZ (comics), TXT/Markdown, FB2/FBZ, plus MOBI/AZW/AZW3 when the server can convert to EPUB; CBR and unsupported originals can be downloaded/opened externally. Themes, text size, margins, table of contents, bookmarks, and progress are supported.
- **Audiobook player (phone + TV)** — cover/metadata, chapters, resume, playback speed, sleep timer (incl. end-of-chapter), and bookmarks, sharing the same Media3 engine as video. TV has a dedicated ten-foot audiobook detail/player flow.

### 🔔 Personalization & engagement (phone + TV)
Multiple **household profiles** per account (PINs, child profiles, content-rating limits, per-profile language/subtitle prefs), favorites & watchlist, ratings, a release **calendar**, and an in-app **notifications inbox** with realtime updates. TV mirrors continue-watching into the system **Watch Next** row.

### 🌐 Multi-server & accounts (phone + TV)
Add and switch between multiple Silo servers (encrypted per-server token slots), use username/password or device/QR sign-in, and manage household profiles. Admin screens are not currently exposed in the Android apps.

## Architecture

Three library layers under two app shells. Dependencies only point downward.

                  └───────────────────────────┘
```

### Modules
- **`shared`** (KMP, `commonMain`) — the cross-platform core: Ktor `HttpClient`, typed API classes, repositories, most ViewModels, domain models, and the `ApiResult` type.
- **`android-shared`** — Android-only playback infrastructure shared by both apps: the Media3 `ContinuumPlaybackService`, player/backend factory, capability probes, the stream-auth OkHttp interceptor, public downloads, and DataStore-backed settings.
- **`androidApp`** — the phone app: Compose Material 3 screens, bottom-nav shell, `MainActivity`.
- **`androidTvApp`** — the TV app: Compose for TV, tvOS-aligned top-menu shell, D-pad focus, `MainTvActivity`, plus TV-only Watch Next integration.

### Networking & auth
- A single Ktor `HttpClient` (OkHttp engine) with content negotiation, WebSockets, timeouts, and a custom **auth plugin** that attaches `Bearer` + profile headers, rewrites relative `/api/*` paths to the active server, and performs **single-flight token refresh** on `401`.
- Media streams (HLS/progressive) are fetched by ExoPlayer **outside** Ktor, so a parallel **`MediaAuthInterceptor`** (OkHttp) mirrors the same token-attach / refresh semantics for stream URLs.
- **`ServerRegistry`** + **`TokenManager`** provide multi-server support with isolated, encrypted per-server token slots. In-memory implementations live in `shared`; the Android apps override them with `EncryptedSharedPreferences`-backed versions via DI.
- Typed API classes (`AuthApi`, `CatalogApi`, `PlaybackApi`, `EbookReaderApi`, `NotificationsApi`, and others) wrap endpoints and return `ApiResult<T>` (`Success` / `Error(code,…)` / `NetworkError`). Repositories sit on top and are the ViewModels' dependency surface. Some APIs exist for inactive surfaces that are not exposed in the current apps.

### Dependency injection (Koin)
`sharedModules()` (network + repositories) is combined with the player and Android modules at app startup. The Android apps override the in-memory `TokenManager`/`ServerRegistry` with persistent implementations. ViewModels are resolved with `koinViewModel()`; nav arguments flow in through Koin parameters / `SavedStateHandle`.

### Navigation & boot
Each app computes a start destination from registry/token/profile/offline state (`ServerSetup → Login → ProfileSelection → main`), then runs a Compose nav graph. The phone uses an Apple-aligned bottom shell (`Home`, `Libraries`, `For You`, `Calendar`, and conditional `Downloads`). The TV uses a tvOS-aligned top menu (`Home`, available media-type tabs, `Calendar`, plus search/profile actions). Deep links handle device pairing (`silo://…` / `continuum://…`).

### Playback pipeline
The UI never owns the player directly — a `MediaController` drives the shared `ContinuumPlaybackService` (a Media3 `MediaSessionService`), so there's exactly one session for system controls. `PlaybackSessionManager` negotiates the play method with the server, `PlaybackSessionLifecycle` handles progress reporting and outage/`404` recovery, and capability probes decide what's advertised. Offline playback bypasses the server entirely via a local `file://` URI.

### Persistence
Per-profile/device player settings live in DataStore (debounced, flushed on `onStop`), tokens in `EncryptedSharedPreferences`, reader/audiobook local state in scoped stores or Room-backed projections, and downloaded bytes in public `MediaStore`/Downloads paths with original filenames and formats.

Tests live in each module's test source set (`commonTest`, `androidUnitTest`) using JUnit / `kotlin.test`, the Ktor `MockEngine` (shared API/repository tests), Robolectric (phone), and coroutines-test.

---

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
- **JDK 21**
- Android SDK with the configured compile SDK (36)
- A running **Silo server** for auth, browsing, and playback validation — see [`Silo-Server/silo-server`](https://github.com/Silo-Server/silo-server)

### Build

```sh
./gradlew :androidApp:assembleDebug
./gradlew :androidTvApp:assembleDebug
```

### Install on a connected device/emulator

```sh
./gradlew :androidApp:installDebug
./gradlew :androidTvApp:installDebug
```

On first launch, point the app at your Silo server URL, sign in, and pick a profile. (Android TV can't bootstrap first-time server setup — set the server up from the phone app or a web browser, then sign the TV in via username/password or QR/device pairing.)

---

## Testing

```sh
./gradlew test                          # all unit tests
./gradlew :shared:testDebugUnitTest     # shared KMP logic (ViewModels, repos, decoders)
./gradlew :android-shared:testDebugUnitTest
./gradlew :androidApp:testDebugUnitTest
./gradlew :androidTvApp:testDebugUnitTest
```

---

## Conventions

- **Kotlin** with `gofmt`-equivalent cleanliness via the project's lint/format setup; keep packages lowercase and focused.
- **Shared first** — put platform-agnostic logic (models, networking, view-model logic, pure algorithms) in `shared`; keep Android-only concerns in `android-shared`; keep each app's module to its UI. New non-UI behavior that both apps need belongs in a shared module, not duplicated per app.
- **Compose** screens are thin; logic lives in ViewModels (testable in `commonTest` where possible).
- Design specs and implementation plans for larger efforts live under `docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/`.
- This is part of a multi-repo Silo workspace — client-visible API/auth/playback changes often need coordinated work in `silo-server` (and the sibling `silo-apple` clients).

---

## Roadmap

Active design work lives in `docs/superpowers/specs/` with phased plans in `docs/superpowers/plans/`. Notable in-flight items:

- **Audiobook polish** — the phone and TV players have chapter-aware UI, speed, bookmarks, and sleep timers. Remaining work includes skip-silence, volume normalization, rich notification polish, Android Auto, and a phone widget.
- **Ebook reader enhancements** — real paginated EPUB (page turns), in-text search, highlights & notes (with a coordinated server change), font/brightness controls, and reading-time estimates across all server formats.
- **Picture-in-Picture** — not yet implemented on phone.
- **Requests, Admin, Watch Together** — code/design work exists, but these are not currently exposed to users in the Android apps and need product/navigation decisions before being treated as live features.

Known gaps the docs track: TV has no reader/ebooks and no downloads management by design; Requests/Admin/Watch Together are not accessible on either Android surface today.

---

## Notes

- Android phone and TV app IDs remain `com.continuum.app` and `com.continuum.app.tv` in this migration.
- The Android modules target Java 21.
- The server repo lives at [`Silo-Server/silo-server`](https://github.com/Silo-Server/silo-server).
