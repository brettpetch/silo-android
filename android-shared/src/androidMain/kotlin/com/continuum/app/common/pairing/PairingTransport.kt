 * This abstracts the real TLS-PSK socket transport away from the
 * [PairingReceiver] state machine so the state machine can be unit-tested over
 * an in-memory fake (no socket / no TLS). The real implementation is
 * [TlsPskPairingTransport]; tests substitute their own.
 *
 * One transport == one connection. Both [send] and [incoming] become inert once
 * the connection closes (transport error, EOF, or [close]); [incoming]
 * completes and [send] throws.
