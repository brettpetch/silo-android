/**
 * Local-first projection of **file-level** user state — resume position, track
 * selections, and ebook reading position.
 *
 * Identity is `(serverId, profileId, contentId, fileId)` because Silo scopes
 * all user state by server + profile (see `ScopedJsonFileStore` and
 * `DownloadStorage`), and progress/track/CFI are file-level (a multi-file
 * content item — e.g. a movie with multiple versions, or an audiobook with
 * many tracks — has independent positions per file).
 *
 * Content-level state (watched / rating / favorite) lives in a separate
 * [ContentItemStateEntity] keyed `(serverId, profileId, contentId)`: those
 * server APIs are keyed by item id only (no fileId), and the mutations can
 * fire before any file row exists, so they do not belong on a file row.
 *
 * Track selections are stored as **stable fingerprints**
 * `(index|language|codec|title|forced)` rather than raw UI indices, so a
 * selection survives a re-extracted track list whose ordering changed.
 *
 * `clientUpdatedAtMs` drives last-writer-wins + resume scans; `serverUpdatedAtMs`
 * is the projection's last-known server timestamp (null until first ack).
